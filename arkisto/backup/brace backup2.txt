I found a workaround that does the trick for me, although it would be more convenient if it was possible to run a command with a simple keyboard combination. There is a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+B) for balancing braces in the Stata do-file editor. I figured that one can use braces even if they weren't necessary needed. All one has to do is to add extra braces above and below of a command and then run an Auto-hotkey script assigned to a desired keyboard combination.

When I press Ctrl+0 the following code is executed as long as the text cursor is between the braces.

[CODE]{
graph bar s7 s8 s10, over(var1, sort(ascend)) ///
 title("Title") ///
 note("Note", pos(b)) ///
 blabel(bar, pos(center) format(%9.0f))  ///
 stack ///
 bar(3, color(219 219 141)) ///
 legend(off)
}[/CODE]

In order to accomplish this, go to https://autohotkey.com/ and download the software.

Write the following script and run it.(Add a shortcut of the script in your startup folder so that is running the next time you start your computer)

[CODE]^0::Send {Control down}bb{Control up}{Up}{Control down}bb{Control up}{Up}{Control down}bb{Control up}{Up}{Control down}bb{Control up}{Up}{Control down}bb{Control up}{Up}{Control down}b{Control up}{pause}^d{down}{Home}


Return[/CODE]

This script balances the braces 6 times so it will work even if you have up to 5 braces in your command. You can always add or remove the "{Control down}bb{Control up}{Up}"-combinations in order to allow for more braces or make the code faster.

If you combine this with my other autohotkey script you will be able to execute commands that are on one line with a one keyboard shortcut and commands on multiple lines with another.

In case someone can improve the solution or has a better way to solve this, I am all ears!
