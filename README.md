# Workflow for Windows
 Shortcuts to make life easier with Autohotkey

This is a list of customized keyboards to switch between windows and do other often repeated tasks in Windows. It consist of three seperate parts:
1) General Windows workflow including hotkeys for switching apps and making repetive tasks faster (1 scripts)
2) Stata workflow (2 scripts)
3) Other useful material

Please refer to shortcut_chart.pub for a quick overview.

## Before you run the code on your device:
- check places with "NB!" in the code as they might require customization for your computer
- if you are not using a Scandinavian keyboard, look for å, ä, ö and adjust the shortcuts for other letters.

This is work in progress. More info in the upcoming months!
