Workflow for Stata - shortcuts to make life easier with Autohotkey

This is a list of customized keyboards to switch between windows and do other often repeated tasks in Stata. Please refer to shortcut_chart.pub for a quick overview.

# Things to consider:
- check places with "NB!" in the code as they might require customization for your computer
- if you are not using a Scandinavian keyboard, look for å, ä, ö and adjust the shortcuts for other letters.

This is work in progress. More info in the upcoming months!
