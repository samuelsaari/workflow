\section*{Introduction}\label{intro}

%%%% Define a research territory (1)
%% General context of the work (1a) - mitä tiedetään parisuhteista ja myöhemmästä hyvinvoinnista. Motivaatio tähän tutkimukseen: (Sample size small)

Romantic relationships are at the heart of our lives. People identify themselves with their relationship status \citep{wangqvistIdentityDevelopmentRomantic2016,luyckxIdentityConfigurationsLove2014}  Pair bonds are the most intimate and often most important relationships, and thus even a lack of romantic relationship is significant.

%% Narrower research area and statement of its importance (1b)
Current relationship status is linked with a multitude of well-being outcomes: life satisfaction, quality of life, health, morbidity or mortality \citep{wongMarriageSocialNetworks2015, hanMaritalStatusAssociated2014,holt-lunstadThereSomethingUnique2008,coombsMaritalStatusPersonal1991, manzoliMaritalStatusMortality2007,waiteDoesMarriageMatter1995b, wangAssociationMaritalRelationship2022a}

%%%% Establish a niche (2)
%% Identification of a gap or other need for research (2a)

The overwhelming majority of existing literature focus either on single relationship events, although understanding romantic bibliographies as part of the life course is vital for understanding the the bibliographies themselves, and how and why the bibliographies are linked with well-being \citep[cf. ]{sasslerPartneringLifeCourse2010}. Although studies examining the interconnectedness of maritial bibliographies and well-being are starting to surface, they currently cover sporadic geographical areas with relatively small samples and do not do not differentiate the analysis by socioeconomic status \citep{oflahertyFamilyLifeCourse2016,zimmermannStableCohabitationalUnions2019}. 

% Specific research question meeting the identified need (2b)
This study will investigate whether partnership trajectories are associated with health and quality of life for men and women among Northern and Western Europeans at the verge of retirement, and how the these outcomes vary by educational attainment.

% (Summary of approach to answer the research question)
Our work contributes to the understanding of the determinants of well-being in old age from a life course perspective. We will create partnership typologies using SHARELIFE interviews of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from 13 European countries. Well-being is measured with subjective health and life satisfaction.


\begin{comment}
Our hypotheses are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Monogamous relationship histories are associated with well-being in old age.
	\item The effect is larger and more consistent for men than for women
	\item We expect the effect of serial cohabitation or single life courses to be pronounced for lowly educated men and dampened for highly educated women.
	\item In addition, we expect larger effect sizes than earlier studies who have been focusing on life courses until the age of 50 or younger.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%--------------------------------------------------
%%%% Background - Hypothesis hand in hand with the litterature
\section*{Background}\label{background}


\subsection*{Why are relationship status and well-being linked?}\label{status}
%~~expect the same way. Monogamy & men.
The empirical evidence for the interconnectedness of marital status and well-being is overwhelming \citep[see ][ for review]{wood2009effects}. What explains the consistency in these findings? Following the review by \citet{dushConsequencesRelationshipStatus2005}, at least three pathways are possible.

%separate how well-being measured
% check also \citep{wykeCompetingExplanationsAssociations1992}

The first alternative is that the already privileged could be selected into  marriages. This would indicate that it is not marriage itself that makes people happy, but happy people get married \citep[cf. ]{koballWhatWeKnow2010}. While some selection effects are at play \citep[see ][ for theoretical overview]{goldmanMarriageSelectionMortality1993}, the majority of empirical results from longitudinal studies suggest that selection alone does not account for the relationships \citep{horwitzBecomingMarriedMental1996, wood2009effects,fuDoesPositiveRelationship2018, gintherMaleMarriagePremium2001}, altough there are exceptions \citep{tuminDoesMarriageProtect2018,mastekaasaMarriagePsychologicalWellBeing1992} 


%There is also some evidence that selection would explain a significant amount of psychological well-being \citep{}. By contrast, \citet{} found that as much as 90\% of marriage premium remains for men after controlling for selection.

Second, the symbolic interactionist perspective argue that roles with high level commitment result in high level of identity and self-worth. ****add stuff from MEAD**** The effects could be further reinforced with social acceptance of those roles \citep{learyMakingSenseSelfEsteem1999}.
% ks koballWhatWeKnow2010

Thirdly, marriage tends to provide social support and regulation beyond any other relationship form \citep{rossReconceptualizingMaritalStatus1995,coombsMaritalStatusPersonal1991,scott2000social}. Individuals who are attached to social networks are healthier and live longer \citep{houseStructuresProcessesSocial1988}. Those in stable marriages have someone in the same household to share the joys and sorrows of life in long term. 

Social regulation can be internal or external. The individuals can have internalized the roles that a married couple takes which the wedding ceremony may further reinforce \citep[:1918]{scott2000social}. By contrast, unconventional behavior may also be sanctioned.  In either case, fulfilling behavioral norms could be the pathway through which marriage fosters well-being. \citep{umbersonFamilyStatusHealth1987}

\citet{umbersonGenderMaritalStatus1992} theorizes that women withstand from behavior that is detrimental to health more often than men and are more likely to control the health behavior of others. Empirical studies support this hypothesis \citep{reczekMaritalHistoriesHeavy2016,westmaas2002effects,lewisSocialControlMarital2007}.  As \citet*{liuTimesTheyAre2008} later notes, men and women are starting to be closer to each other in this regard, which would seem to indicate that the well-being outcomes could be similar for both genders, but possibly more consistent for men.

 As new relationship forms become more common, the effects of marriage on well-being could disappear. While there is some evidence to this claim there is a tendency to downplay the benefits of marriage and exaggerate or extrapolate current trends \citet[cf.]{liuTimesTheyAre2008,mastekaasaMaritalStatusSubjective1993}.

In addition, social norms could explain the well-being premium. As opposed to sanctioning behavior within a given role, societies and communities reward choosing acceptable relation forms and penalize from deviant behavior. 

Empirical support for this argument is limited. \citet{dienerSimilarityRelationsMarital2000} studied the relationship of marital status and subjective well-being in 42 countries and found out that differences in effect sizes between collectivist and individual cultures were miniscule compared with the main effect of marital status. \citep{verbakelSubjectiveWellBeingPartnership2012} concludes with a similar study design that "normative climate appears to hardly affect well-being gaps between partnership statuses".It seems plausible that there is something in the structure of the relationship formation itself that would directly impact how people experience relationship statuses.

%We conclude that that there is innately something in the structure of relationships that could explain differences in well-being outcomes, as opposed to perceptions, norms and expectations.


%Could traditional family values are still be so dominant globally that the people cannot yet freely choose the family structures for themselves that they wish? 

%studies that people still want to marry \citep{cherlinDegreesChangeAssessment2020}
%\citep{vespaHistoricalTrendsMarital2014}

Being single, divorced or widowed—which often implies living alone—are qualitatively quite different from living with a partner. The experience and well-being outcomes of even the unpartnered groups, can nevertheless be very different and should thus be treated separately \citep[cf. ]{naessMaritalStatusSuicide2021, pinquartLonelinessMarriedWidowed2003}

Cohabitation, on the contrary, seems rather similar to marriage. As civil unions have become more common, many states have introduced legal policies previously associated with marriage only \citep{perelli-harrisChangesPartnershipPatterns2015}. Cohabitation fits at least partially under all anthropological definitions of marriage, whether defined by custom or law \citep{westermarckFutureMarriageWestern1936}, establishment of paternity (although not automatically) \citep*[:111]{royalanthropologicalinsitituteNotesQueriesAnthropology1951},  sexual exclusivity, rights to property, labour services and affinity with kin \citep{leachPolyandryInheritanceDefinition1955}. As the legal and social rights and obligations for cohabitation are bound to increase in the future, we should expect cohabitation to move closer to marriage. According to the deinstitutionalization theory \citep{cherlinDeinstitutionalizationAmericanMarriage2004}, marriage will also come closer to cohabitation, but the change is still under progress \citep{cherlinDegreesChangeAssessment2020}.

Although cohabitation is approaching marriage both legally and socially, there is still a clear difference in terms of commitment, longevity and symbolic importance \citep[cf.]{barlow2001just, cherlinDeinstitutionalizationAmericanMarriage2004,raultCivilSolidarityPact2019}. If they will be indistinguishable in the future, it—in effect—would mean that cohabitation would fully have become marriage in the anthropological sense. Interestingly, cohabitation seems already to be an alternative to marriage in new relationships among older adults \citep{brownMarriageCohabitationDivorce2017}.

Similarly, first and higher order marriages differ in terms of stability, relationship satisfaction, and demographic make-up \citep{zahl-olsenDivorceRemarriageNorway2019, hagglundVanheneeKuinHyva2021,boothStartingWhyRemarriages1992}, which is why later life outcomes should be different as well.

Taking all of this together we hypothesize (1a) stable monogamous relationship
histories are associated with well-being in old age. We predict (1b) the more unstable the relationship histories are and the more they tend to be without a partnership, they less well off they generally are. Finally, we expect similar results for both sexes, but slightly more robust and consistent results for women.

% In any case, for these cohorts cohabitation is distinctly different to marriage. Rather, cohabitation spells tend to be short and

%%%% Data and Methods

\section*{Data and methods}\label{datamethods}


Life histories were generated with the help of the SHARELIFE interviews of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe \citep{borsch2019share}. SHARE is a micro panel data infrastructure that covers 28 European countries. The SHARELIFE pseudo-panel interviews were conducted in 2008 and 2017 (wave 3 and 7, respectively) contain modules for childhood circumstances, relationships and well-being measures at the time of interview. If the life history interviews were conducted in 2008, the missing information was filled with panel interview data until 2017.

We selected those baby-boomers from Northern and Western Europe that were at least 60 years of age in 2017. By restricting the sample would not be too heterogenous; by extending the life courses until the verge of retirement, we could study health effects that are known to develop over time. The final sample size for analysis was 18256.

The first part of the analyses was creating relationship history typologies. In addition to singlehood, marriage, divorce and widowhood, we also included cohabitation, dating, and second or higher order marriages, as they differ from first marriages both conceptually and in well-being outcomes \citep{zahl-olsenDivorceRemarriageNorway2019,boothJustLivingTogether2002,brownMarriageCohabitationDivorce2017}.

The typologies were created by sequence analysis. We started off by creating a distance matrix with dynamic hamming method:

\begin{equation}
	s_p(A,B) = 4 -
	\begin{bmatrix}
	pr(X_p=A|X_{p-1} = B ) + & pr(X_p=B|X_{p-1} = A ) + \\
	pr(X_{p+1}=A|X_{p}= B) + & pr(X_{p+1}=B|X_{p}=A)
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:dynamic_hamming}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $s_p(A,B)$ is substitution cost at position $p$ and $X_p$ is the state at the $p^{th}$ position. \citep[:128]{cornwellSocialSequenceAnalysis2015}

That way the substitution costs are calculated automatically based on how common a certain transition is at a given age—rather than imposing subjective substitution costs that might not reflect reality.

Thereafter the clusters were formed with Ward's agglomerative clustering, which minimizes within cluster sum of squares and, as a result, produces groups with similar life histories.  We also experimented with other algorithms but the clustering alternatives with Ward made most sense conceptually. 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\Delta(A, B) &=\sum_{i \in \Lambda \cup B}\left\|\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{m}_{A \cup B}\right\|^{2}-\sum_{i \in A}\left\|\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{m}_{A}\right\|^{2}-\sum_{i \in B}\left\|\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{m}_{B}\right\|^{2} \\
	&=\frac{n_{A} n_{B}}{n_{A}+n_{B}}\left\|\vec{m}_{A}-\vec{m}_{B}\right\|^{2}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta$ is the merging cost of $A$ and $B$ and $\vec{m}_{A}$,$\vec{m}_{A}$,$\vec{x}_{i}$ are the centers of indivudual and combined clusters. \citep[:231]{kaufmanFindingGroupsData1990a}

Initially, we added a second channel with children histories, but the clusters depended almost entirely on the completed number of children, irregardless which algorithm we used. As a results, we dropped the children channel and added number of children to one of the control variables.

The typologies were created together for both genders for two reasons: First, we we wanted to compare differences in well-being outcomes by gender. Second, the relationship histories of men and women are by definition heavily interrelated. In addition, the cluster solutions resembled one another even if the typologies were created separately.

%% For the second stage of the analysis, or the regressions, we stratified the sample by gender. While the relationship histories did not differ, their effects could be different for men and women as suggested by (!!ref \& !!ref). Men and women could respond to similar life events differently or heterogamy could explain why certain relationship types could be more detrimental for some than others: the relationships histories are inherently interconnected.

Health was measured by a one-shot subjective health question and well-being by self-reported life satisfaction, as they are direct and established ways to access well-being.\citep{fischerSubjectiveWellBeingWelfare2009,jenkinsonMeasuringHealthMedical2013} Robustness checks were carried out with grip strength—an objective, consistent and versatile estimator for health \citep{bohannonGripStrengthIndispensable2019}—, and CASP-12, an old age quality of life indicator with a robust theoretical framework \citep{borrat-bessonEvaluationCASP12Scale2015}.

We treated subjective health and life satisfaction as continuous to preserve comparability with Grip Strength and CASP-12. As \citet[:214-215]{agrestiFoundationsLinearGeneralized2015} points out, using OLS for ordinal response variables can lead to misleading results because of ceiling and floor effects. Therefore we will perform robustness checks with ordinal regression to ensure that such effects are not present.

First regression model does not have any controls, and thus gives as the raw effects of the clusters. Second or main model has controls variable that are not endogenous to the clusters themselves: age, family composition at 10 years of age, and childhood socio-economic background measured by number of books, features and rooms at home, and whether respondent experienced hunger as a minor \citep[see ][for a discussion about the realibility of these measures]{havariCanWeTrust2015}. The third model is an over-controlled one; it makes sure the cluster effects are not merely artifacts of the number of children, educational attainment or income - albeit it is questionable whether such variables that are so heavily influenced by the relationship histories should be included in the first place.

Final model consists of only cluster and education interaction effects for simplicity \toAorB{}{(The results were identical with controls.)} Our intention was to build a three-way interaction effect model with the number of children but the sample size was not large enough for reliable results.

Missing values (please refer to \autoref{tab:descriptives}) were handled with multiple imputation. The analyses were conducted with 6 imputed datasets. 

After wrangling the data with Stata, all the analyses were conducted with R: Sequence Analyses with the package TraMineR \citep{gabadinhoAnalyzingVisualizingState2011}, visualizations with ggplot2 and jtools \citep{wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016,jtools}, multiple imputation with mice \citep{vanbuurenMiceMultivariateImputation2011}, interaction forecasting with emmeans \citep{lenthEmmeansEstimatedMarginal2021}, and tables with table1 \citep{richTable1TablesDescriptive2021}.

A five cluster solution (\autoref{fig:clusters_and_title}) was the most optimal according to both goodness-of-fit tests and visual inspection (\autoref{fig:s_cluster_fit_comparisons_only_both} and \autoref{fig:tree.s}).

The \emph{monogamous} (1) cluster  is emphasized by a brief period of dating - and sometimes cohabitation - proceeded with a permanent first marriage by the late 20s.

In the \emph{remarriage} (2) group, tend to marry around their twenties and remarry relatively soon. Cohabitation is common in-between the marriages. It comprises of first marriages that dissolve usually between early 30s and 40s followed by varied states often involving quite a lot of complexity.

The \emph{divorce} (3) cluster is practically identical to the first two clusters until mid-twenties. Unlike in the previous cluster, people will stay single, widowed or starting dating or start cohabiting after divorce but do not generally get married again.

Marriages in the \emph{serial cohabitation} (4) cluster are rare and they usually end in divorce. Cohabiting and dating are prominent even in older ages, owing at least in part to the fact that there is a considerable amount of variation in the relationship stages after the initial period of singlehood. The sequence index plot (see \autoref{fig:indices_and_title}) reveals that the cluster is in fact characterized by serial as opposed to stable cohabitation.

The vast majority in the \emph{single} (5) cluster never date or co-reside. Those who do, will by and large return to singlehood in a matter of few years.

The demographics of the clusters resemble each other by and large (see \autoref{tab:descriptives}). There are a few exceptions to this rule: men are overrepresented in the single and women in the divorce group. While the education differences are not substantial, male education attainment nonetheless decreases the less they are married during their lives while it is the very opposite for women.

The proportion of people in each cluster do not vary much from country to country. Early monogamous trajectories are by far the most common and single trajectories most rare in every country, although the difference in size to other clusters is not always considerable.

Further inspection by multinominal regression revealed that some Northern European respondents were more likely to belong to the serial cohabitation group, but other than that, there were not distinct patterns \toAorB{(results omitted for brevity).}{see \autoref{tab:multinom_ref_1}).

%%%% Well-being outcomes
\subsection*{Well-being outcomes}\label{wellbeing}

Monogamous partnership histories (1) tended to be associated with higher subjective health and especially with life satisfaction (\autoref{fig:multi_sub_life}). The effects remain after controls in model 2 and even in the over controlled model 3. 

Life histories characterized by singlehood (5) and dissolution but not remarriage (3) seem to be most vulnerable to lower wellbeing at old age. 

While the direction of association was as expected, the wellbeing of men in the remarriage cluster was not statistically worse when compared with those with monogamous histories. For women, the effect is larger but only barely significant.

Serial cohabitation (4) was disadvantageous for men. For women the association depends on education: Highly educated women who serially cohabit fare off best out of everyone in all groups, while those with basic or secondary education seemed to suffer from such complex histories.

Similar trend goes with those in the divorce (3) cluster for sexes. Higher education seems to shelter from the adverse effects of union dissolution. Basic and secondary educated are considerably worse off if their first marriage has dissolved and they have not remarried.

% rename divorce to dissolution or similar



The association was not statistically significant for men in the remarriage cluster. The effect sizes were small for women with serial cohabitation histories. The same goes for the life satisfaction for the remarriage cluster.

The results were similiar when measured with grip strength and CASP-12 (\autoref{fig:multi_grip_casp}). The effect sizes were mainly larger with the exception of grip strength for women, where we found no associations.

As subjective health and life satisfaction were measured on 5 and 11 point scales, we ran the analyses also using ordinal regression. The results were practically identical with the OLS\toAorB{.}{ (see \autoref{fig:polr.all.3}).}

%%%% Discussion and conclusion
\section*{Discussion and conclusion}\label{discussion}

%%%% Interpretation of results
Normative relationship histories are associated with well-being in old age. Our results imply that lower education catalyzes the effect of unstable trajectories, while higher education might even reverse the direction of the relationship, especially for women. 

%% Comparison or synthesis with results from litterature

The fact that clusters had no effect on grip strength for women is in line with \citet{oflahertyFamilyLifeCourse2016} who found no psychical health outcomes for women and partnership histories, unless both their marital history was disrupted and they had high fertility. These findings combined would suggest that subjective health could reflect overall contentment whereas grip strength, which is an objective measurement like morbidity, could be more independent of life satisfaction.

Unlike \citep{zimmermannStableCohabitationalUnions2019} our study did find evidence that relationship histories are linked with self-assessed health and quality of life measures also for women, which suggests that the in order to discern the effects of partnership histories, one will have to wait as long as until the verge of retirement for the effects to kick in.

%%%% COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH CROSS-SECTIONAL RESEARCH

% ?? Income women does not reflect their well-being but their partners might.


%% Surprising results?

It came as no surprise that stable single life courses were the worst off, and that those findings were pronounced in men (see !!!ref for review). What stroke as was that permanent singlehood hit people of all education levels with the same magnitude.

While education divided the unstable trajectories, we did expect more substantial evidence of cumulative advantage: stable relationship histories in the highly educated did not result in even higher well-being outcomes. It is possible that in these cohorts the norm for monogamous trajectories has been so given that the well-being effects are distributed equally. On the contrary, following a non-normative path could be rewarded differently in different strata of society.

It is equally possible that those with less resources have inferior opportunities to compensate for life course patterns that tend to deteriorate well-being. We could conclude that education might work as a catalyst or damper when people act against expectations: if their behavior is normative, the effects are will not vary in different demographic segments.

Based on earlier literature (!!!ref), we were were expecting a more distinguishable difference between trajectories characterized by remarriages and those of first marriages. The direction of the relationship was nonetheless  as expected.

% no intersectionality or cumulative disadvantage?

% Advantages
% cross-national
% until 60 (not before)
% educational attainment (not before)
% clear and robust results

Following the life courses until the age of 60 allowed for especially health outcomes to develop, thus emphasizing how life course events increase in magnitude as time elapses. Studying the relationship histories for such a long time period explains at least in part why the effect sizes were so notable. Cross-national sample made it possible to infer general trends and allowed for a reasonable sample size, which also made studying interaction effects possible.


%%%% Possible weaknesses
% ?? Too many weaknesses, remove some?


A pseudo panel has the unfortunate feature that it is more or less selective. Not only are those better off and in relationships more likely to participate (!!ref), but those who have passed away are excluded by design.

%Although the distribution of cluster membership was somewhat even, one trajectory could be sanctioned differently between countries. Granted, this holds for intra-national differences, such as former East and West Germany and the urban-rural division.


The union histories presented here could well reflect the end stages of the relationship histories as most of the people in any given cluster have the same partnership status with one another. How does studying life courses then differ from studying partnership statuses in old age? As we have demonstrated above, well-being effects take decades to develop. Furthermore, a long and stable cohabiting union is qualitatively different from serial cohabitation; someone who gets married for the first time just before retirement certainly  is expected to have led a unique life compared with someone who has been married since their early 20s. Thus, the question can be reversed: why study the current relationship status if that is merely a proxy for relationship histories?

%The retrospective inquiries might not be the most accurate childhood SES estimators. Yet, they offer a glimpse into the time just before the relationship histories start to develop. Even if we did control for childhood circumstances and in the """tårta på tårta""" model income and education, it is possible that some selection """is in play""": advantage start to accumulate in the womb.

%As noted above, most considerations revolve around the appropriateness of survey data in our study setting. As we were interested in outcomes that require subjective assessment or objective measurements as well as information on cohabiting and LAT-relationships in Northern and Western Europe, SHARELIFE data served that purpose well.

% Having said that, our data enabled finding patterns in Northern and Western Europe and hinting towards over-arching trends.

%%%% Broader implications.
%% how does relate to other research questions?


The results are in line with the consensus of earlier research: stable monogamous first marriages are associated with a range of well-being outcomes. (\citep{demoSinglehoodMarriageRemarriage1996,kimRelationshipMarriagePsychological2002}) Our findings reinforce the idea that differences in well-being diverge in old age and they take a long time to develop \citep{kuhLifeCourseEpidemiology2003}.

As the effect of non-traditional life courses were dependent on education attainment with this baby-boomer cohort, we should expect similar trends with regards to the even less common organization of love life that are becoming mainstream in the 2020s: those with cultural, social and monetary capital could seem to benefit from non-standard love life; the less well off would not fare so well. The highly educated women in these cohorts who had resources for serial cohabitation were likely a distinct group. Once new forms of family life become commonplace it remains to be seen whether they will affect all demographics the same way.

While social expectations could partly explain the well-being effects, it is likely that the relationship histories themselves are the main factor: studies with younger cohorts where divorce and serial cohabitation has become normative have produced similar findings \citep{lichterSerialCohabitationMarital2008}.

% vähä kuin ne naiset jotka ovat serial cohabitators ja menee hyvin.

It is most fruitful to study phenomena when the social sanctions are equal. That is rarely the case. Even so, finding patterns in early age when societal changes are just happening could give us vital information what new currents might bring along with them.

%%%% Prospects for future research

Future research could investigate why objective health measures are not associated with well-being for women. Qualitative inquiries could further inform about at the mechanisms behind these differences. Register studies could dig deeper into the combined effect of education, number of children and other demographic characteristics.

More generally, as other relationship forms become more popular, it will be interesting to see whether they will eventually have similar well-being effects as stable marriages. That is, are the well-being outcomes a function of the structure of the relationships or norms regulating family life. 

% Conclusion

Life courses characterized with stable marriages tend to be coupled with good health and high quality of life. Unstable and single histories less so. Education pronounces the effects of unstable love histories and might even reverse them. This hints at family formation patterns that foster well-being, having direct implications on both individual and societal level.
