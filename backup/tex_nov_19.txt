\section*{Introduction}\label{intro}

%%%% Define a research territory (1)
%% General context of the work (1a) - mitä tiedetään parisuhteista ja myöhemmästä hyvinvoinnista. Motivaatio tähän tutkimukseen: (Sample size small)

Pair bonds are the most intimate and often most important relationships, and thus even a lack of romantic relationship is significant. Defining our identities, they are at the core of our being \citep{wangqvistIdentityDevelopmentRomantic2016,luyckxIdentityConfigurationsLove2014}.  

%% Narrower research area and statement of its importance (1b)
Current relationship status is linked with a multitude of well-being outcomes: life satisfaction, quality of life, health, morbidity or mortality \citep{wongMarriageSocialNetworks2015, hanMaritalStatusAssociated2014,holt-lunstadThereSomethingUnique2008,coombsMaritalStatusPersonal1991, manzoliMaritalStatusMortality2007,waiteDoesMarriageMatter1995b, wangAssociationMaritalRelationship2022a}

%%%% Establish a niche (2)
%% Identification of a gap or other need for research (2a)

The overwhelming majority of existing literature focus either on single relationship events or static ways of depicting life course events, although understanding romantic bibliographies as part of the life course is vital for understanding the the bibliographies themselves, and how and why the bibliographies are linked with well-being \citep[cf. ][]{sasslerPartneringLifeCourse2010}. Although studies examining the interconnectedness of maritial bibliographies and well-being are starting to surface, they currently cover sporadic geographical areas with relatively small samples and do not do not differentiate the analysis by socioeconomic status \citep{oflahertyFamilyLifeCourse2016,zimmermannStableCohabitationalUnions2019}. 

% Specific research question meeting the identified need (2b)
This study will investigate whether partnership trajectories are associated with health and quality of life for men and women among Northern and Western Europeans at the verge of retirement, and how the these outcomes vary by educational attainment.

% (Summary of approach to answer the research question)
Our work contributes to the understanding of the determinants of well-being in old age from a life course perspective. We will create partnership typologies using SHARELIFE interviews of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from 13 European countries. Well-being is measured with subjective health and life satisfaction.


%%%%--------------------------------------------------
%%%% Background - Hypothesis hand in hand with the litterature
\section*{Background}\label{background}


\subsection*{Why are relationship status and well-being linked?}\label{status}
%~~expect the same way. Monogamy & men.
The empirical evidence for the interconnectedness of marital status and well-being is overwhelming \citep[see ][ for review]{wood2009effects}. What explains the consistency in these findings? Following the review by \citet{dushConsequencesRelationshipStatus2005}, at least three pathways are possible.

%separate how well-being measured
% check also \citep{wykeCompetingExplanationsAssociations1992}

The first alternative is that the already privileged could be selected into  marriages. This would indicate that it is not marriage itself that makes people happy, but happy people get married \citep[cf. ]{koballWhatWeKnow2010}. While some selection effects are at play \citep[see ][ for theoretical overview]{goldmanMarriageSelectionMortality1993}, the majority of empirical results from longitudinal studies suggest that selection alone does not account for the relationships \citep{horwitzBecomingMarriedMental1996, wood2009effects,fuDoesPositiveRelationship2018, gintherMaleMarriagePremium2001}, altough there are exceptions \citep{tuminDoesMarriageProtect2018,mastekaasaMarriagePsychologicalWellBeing1992} 


%There is also some evidence that selection would explain a significant amount of psychological well-being \citep{}. By contrast, \citet{} found that as much as 90\% of marriage premium remains for men after controlling for selection.

Second, the symbolic interactionist perspective argue that roles with high level commitment result in high level of identity and self-worth. ****add stuff from MEAD**** The effects could be further reinforced with social acceptance of those roles \citep{learyMakingSenseSelfEsteem1999}.
% ks koballWhatWeKnow2010

% ADD symbolic interactionism

Thirdly, marriage tends to provide social support and regulation beyond any other relationship form \citep{rossReconceptualizingMaritalStatus1995,coombsMaritalStatusPersonal1991,scott2000social}. Individuals who are attached to social networks are healthier and live longer \citep{houseStructuresProcessesSocial1988}. Those in stable marriages have someone in the same household to share the joys and sorrows of life in long term. 

Social regulation can be internal or external. The individuals can have internalized the roles that a married couple takes which the wedding ceremony may further reinforce \citep[:1918]{scott2000social}. By contrast, unconventional behavior may also be sanctioned.  In either case, fulfilling behavioral norms could be the pathway through which marriage fosters well-being. \citep{umbersonFamilyStatusHealth1987}

\citet{umbersonGenderMaritalStatus1992} theorizes that women withstand from behavior that is detrimental to health more often than men and are more likely to control the health behavior of others. Empirical studies support this hypothesis \citep{reczekMaritalHistoriesHeavy2016,westmaas2002effects,lewisSocialControlMarital2007}.  As \citet*{liuTimesTheyAre2008} later notes, men and women are starting to be closer to each other in this regard, which would seem to indicate that the well-being outcomes could be similar for both genders, but possibly more consistent for men.

As new relationship forms become more common, the effects of marriage on well-being could disappear. While there is some evidence to this claim there is a tendency to downplay the benefits of marriage and exaggerate or extrapolate current trends \citet[cf.]{liuTimesTheyAre2008,mastekaasaMaritalStatusSubjective1993}.

In addition, social norms could explain the well-being premium. As opposed to sanctioning behavior within a given role, societies and communities reward choosing acceptable relation forms and penalize from deviant behavior. 

Empirical support for this argument is limited. \citet{dienerSimilarityRelationsMarital2000} studied the relationship of marital status and subjective well-being in 42 countries and found out that differences in effect sizes between collectivist and individual cultures were miniscule compared with the main effect of marital status. \citep{verbakelSubjectiveWellBeingPartnership2012} concludes with a similar study design that "normative climate appears to hardly affect well-being gaps between partnership statuses".It seems plausible that there is something in the structure of the relationship formation itself that would directly impact how people experience relationship statuses.

%We conclude that that there is innately something in the structure of relationships that could explain differences in well-being outcomes, as opposed to perceptions, norms and expectations.


%Could traditional family values are still be so dominant globally that the people cannot yet freely choose the family structures for themselves that they wish? 

%studies that people still want to marry \citep{cherlinDegreesChangeAssessment2020}
%\citep{vespaHistoricalTrendsMarital2014}

Being single, divorced or widowed—which often implies living alone—are qualitatively quite different from living with a partner. The experience and well-being outcomes of even the unpartnered groups, can nevertheless be very different and should thus be treated separately \citep[cf. ]{naessMaritalStatusSuicide2021, pinquartLonelinessMarriedWidowed2003}

Cohabitation, on the contrary, seems rather similar to marriage. As civil unions have become more common, many states have introduced legal policies previously associated with marriage only \citep{perelli-harrisChangesPartnershipPatterns2015}. Cohabitation fits at least partially under all anthropological definitions of marriage, whether defined by custom or law \citep{westermarckFutureMarriageWestern1936}, establishment of paternity (although not automatically) \citep*[:111]{royalanthropologicalinsitituteNotesQueriesAnthropology1951},  sexual exclusivity, rights to property, labour services and affinity with kin \citep{leachPolyandryInheritanceDefinition1955}. As the legal and social rights and obligations for cohabitation are bound to increase in the future, we should expect cohabitation to move closer to marriage. According to the deinstitutionalization theory \citep{cherlinDeinstitutionalizationAmericanMarriage2004}, marriage will also come closer to cohabitation, but the change is still under progress \citep{cherlinDegreesChangeAssessment2020}.

Although cohabitation is approaching marriage both legally and socially, there is still a clear difference in terms of commitment, longevity and symbolic importance \citep[cf.]{barlow2001just, cherlinDeinstitutionalizationAmericanMarriage2004,raultCivilSolidarityPact2019}. If they will be indistinguishable in the future, it—in effect—would mean that cohabitation would fully have become marriage in the anthropological sense. Interestingly, cohabitation seems already to be an alternative to marriage in new relationships among older adults \citep{brownMarriageCohabitationDivorce2017}.

Similarly, first and higher order marriages differ in terms of stability, relationship satisfaction, and demographic make-up \citep{zahl-olsenDivorceRemarriageNorway2019, hagglundVanheneeKuinHyva2021,boothStartingWhyRemarriages1992}, which is why later life outcomes should be different as well.

Taking all of this together we hypothesize (1a) stable monogamous relationship
histories are associated with well-being in old age. We predict (1b) the more unstable the relationship histories are and the more they tend to be without a partnership, they less well off they generally are. Finally, we expect similar results for both sexes, but slightly more robust and consistent results for men.

% In any case, for these cohorts cohabitation is distinctly different to marriage. Rather, cohabitation spells tend to be short and

\subsection*{Cumulative advantage and disadvantage over the life course}\label{cumulative}
%%%%---> % life course & cumulative advantage - temporal & topical accumulation
%"We conceptualize cumulative disadvantage to mean that disadvantaged positions interact to produce an effect that are stronger than the sum of the individual additive effects"
% increasingly aware that need to understand not just indiviual evens


%% general

The theory of cumulative dis/advantage falls within the larger  framework of the life course which which "looks at how chronological age, relationships, common life transitions, life events, social change, and human agency shape people’s lives from birth to death"  \citep{hutchisonLifeCourseTheory2011}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ADD definition

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Events even early on in life can have consequences later on. \citet{ploubidisLifelongSocioEconomic2014} found out that socioeconomic status in childhood is linked with health at least 65 years later. In fact, life-course well-being defining  events start already in the womb \citep{godfreyFetalNutritionAdult2000}

Cumulative dis/advantage is the intraindividual tendency of systematic divergence of a given characteristic with the passage of time \citep{danneferCumulativeAdvantageDisadvantage2003}. One disadvantage tends to increase the harm of another \citep{pampelSocioeconomicStatusSmoking2004}. The ageing process is a result  accumulated dis/advantages over the years \citep{meloTheoryCumulativeDisadvantage2019}. 

The theory was initially conceptualized by \citet{priceNetworksScientificPapers1965} and \citet{mertonMatthewEffectScience1968,mertonMatthewEffectScience1988} who observed that both citations and publications start to accumulate for certain scientists. The idea has been applied to other areas of life and further developed \citep[see reviews in ][]{meloTheoryCumulativeDisadvantage2019,o2009cumulative} , but the idea is still essentially the same:success breeds success and vice versa.

\citet{ferraroCumulativeInequalityTheory2009} takes the theory into the context of ageing, give five falsifiable axioms and call it cumulative inequality, although the core idea remains unchanged. Thus we use the terms interchangeably here. 

First, social systems are the main factors of inequality, as opposed to human agency. What they add to the existing literature is an emphasis on demographic and developmental processes, or cohort- and age-linked stimuli. It is not only at what age certain events happen but under what shared circumstances.

Second, disadvantage exposes to risks while advantage exposes to opportunites. The authors point out that disadvantage probably has greater impact than advantage and thus the mechanisms to both directions should be separated as well. 

Third, risk, resources and human agency tend to accumulate. "As the risks accumulate, further disadvantage is likely to result
unless measures are undertaken to offset the exposure to risks." \citep[:424]{ferraroCumulativeInequalityTheory2009} While social structures are the main factor, the authors suggest that 
social, economic, and psychological resources as well as personal efforts can, nonetheless, sometimes help transforming structural barriers into their benefit.

Fourth, the perception of trajectories could influence subsequent bibliographies. How people see themselves in social hierarchies is what would matter. This is seemingly at odds with what we concluded in the previous chapter. Namely, in the well-being gradient of marital status was similar in different countries. Either marital status does not bear with it the kind of hierarchical meanings \citeauthor{ferraroCumulativeInequalityTheory2009} mean, the hierarchical structures are identical cross-nationally, or—along the line of argumentation in the previous chapter—the direct effects of relationship statuses exceed those of the perceptions.

Finally, accumulated disadvantage may lead to premature death. Therefore the cumulative disadvantage may seem fainter due to a biased sample.

Following \citet{dipreteCumulativeAdvantageMechanism2006} relationship histories are exposed to both strict and status attainment forms of cumulative dis/advantage. Strict in the sense that family background and early relationship events an predict future trajetories \citep{fasangTransmissionIntergenerationalPatterns2014,ansfordansfordIntergenerationalContinuityStability2019,mclanahanIntergenerationalConsequencesFamily1988}; status attainment—or its "status resource form"— in the sense that impact of relationship bibliographies varies between different demographics \citep{jalovaaraSocioeconomicDifferentialsDivorce2002,heardSocioeconomicDifferencesFamily}.

Education predicts a multitude of well-being outcomes
\citep[see ][ for reviews.]{zajacovaRelationshipEducationHealth2018}. \citet{rossLinksEducationHealth1995} suggest three pathways: work related resources, such as low economic hardship and fulfilling full-time jobs; social-psychological resources such as sense of control and social support, and health behavior. They are all privileges the highly educated are more likely to enjoy.

The accumulation of human, social and personal capital are anchored in educational attainment in early life \citep{orandStratificationLifeCourse2001}.  By studying the interaction effects with education, it is possible to identify how people with different resources react to different romantic life histories. 

The gap between educational groups widens during the ageing process, at least in health outcomes \citep{mirowskyEducationSelfRatedHealth2008,rossEducationAgeCumulative1996}. \citet{mirowskyEducationCumulativeAdvantage2005} argue that this is because education transforms individuals and puts them on a different track, or in other words it is like a structural beam on which other elements of life rest on.



As education is an achieved, rather than ascribed status, the combined effects of relationship histories and education could be multiplicative as opposed to additive \citep[cf. ][]{pampelSocioeconomicStatusSmoking2004, orandProcessesCumulativeAdversity2005}. Indeed, as \citet{meloTheoryCumulativeDisadvantage2019} puts it: "[e]ducation reproduces and expands early advantages of social background" which will determine later life outcomes. Furthermore, education mediates the risks of social origins and provides means to escape earlier disadvantage  \citep{o2009cumulative}. As the lowly educated have less resources, their benefits and deficits of partnership histories should be pronounced when compared with the highly educated \citep{mirowskyEducationCumulativeAdvantage2005}

The empirical literature the well-being outcomes of marital statuses by educational attainment is scarce\toAorB{(!!!REF)**Are there any studies???***}{}. For example \citet{beckerTheoryMarriagePart1973} claims that gain from marriage depends on traits, such as attractiveness, intelligence and education, but does not back it up with data or elaborate how the gain varies by those traits. Simlilarly, if education or education interaction effects are included, they work as controls as opposed to stratifying the analysis \citep{boyceBetterWorseModerating2016,hanMaritalStatusAssociated2014,wongMarriageSocialNetworks2015}. In any case, we are not aware of any studies that would study the interaction of education and partnership trajectories on well-being. 


Based on the cumulative dis/advantage theory outlined above, however, we expect low, we expect (2a) low education to catalyzes the negative well-being effects of unstable partnership histories; (2b) high education to catalyzes the positive well-being effects of stable partnership histories, but to a lesser extend, and (2c) that the well-being effects are larger than observed in studies with younger study groups.



%%%%-----------------------------------------------
%%%% Data and Methods

\section*{Data and methods}\label{datamethods}


Life histories were generated with the help of the SHARELIFE interviews of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe \citep{borsch2019share}. SHARE is a micro panel data infrastructure that covers 28 European countries. The SHARELIFE pseudo-panel interviews were conducted in 2008 and 2017 (wave 3 and 7, respectively) contain modules for childhood circumstances, relationships and well-being measures at the time of interview. If the life history interviews were conducted in 2008, the missing information was filled with panel interview data until 2017.

We selected those baby-boomers from Northern and Western Europe that were at least 60 years of age in 2017. By restricting the sample would not be too heterogenous; by extending the life courses until the verge of retirement, we could study health effects that are known to develop over time. The final sample size for analysis was 18256.

The first part of the analyses was creating relationship history typologies. In addition to singlehood, marriage, divorce and widowhood, we also included cohabitation, dating, and second or higher order marriages, as they differ from first marriages both conceptually and in well-being outcomes \citep{zahl-olsenDivorceRemarriageNorway2019,boothJustLivingTogether2002,brownMarriageCohabitationDivorce2017}.

The typologies were created by sequence analysis. We started off by creating a distance matrix with dynamic hamming method:

\begin{equation}
	s_p(A,B) = 4 -
	\begin{bmatrix}
	pr(X_p=A|X_{p-1} = B ) + & pr(X_p=B|X_{p-1} = A ) + \\
	pr(X_{p+1}=A|X_{p}= B) + & pr(X_{p+1}=B|X_{p}=A)
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:dynamic_hamming}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $s_p(A,B)$ is substitution cost at position $p$ and $X_p$ is the state at the $p^{th}$ position. \citep[:128]{cornwellSocialSequenceAnalysis2015}

That way the substitution costs are calculated automatically based on how common a certain transition is at a given age—rather than imposing subjective substitution costs that might not reflect reality.

Thereafter the clusters were formed with Ward's agglomerative clustering, which minimizes within cluster sum of squares and, as a result, produces groups with similar life histories.  We also experimented with other algorithms but the clustering alternatives with Ward made most sense conceptually. 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\Delta(A, B) &=\sum_{i \in \Lambda \cup B}\left\|\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{m}_{A \cup B}\right\|^{2}-\sum_{i \in A}\left\|\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{m}_{A}\right\|^{2}-\sum_{i \in B}\left\|\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{m}_{B}\right\|^{2} \\
	&=\frac{n_{A} n_{B}}{n_{A}+n_{B}}\left\|\vec{m}_{A}-\vec{m}_{B}\right\|^{2}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta$ is the merging cost of $A$ and $B$ and $\vec{m}_{A}$,$\vec{m}_{A}$,$\vec{x}_{i}$ are the centers of indivudual and combined clusters. \citep[:231]{kaufmanFindingGroupsData1990a}

Initially, we added a second channel with children histories, but the clusters depended almost entirely on the completed number of children, irregardless which algorithm we used. As a result, we dropped the children channel and added number of children to one of the control variables.

The typologies were created together for both genders for two reasons. First, we we wanted to compare differences in well-being outcomes by gender. Second, the relationship histories of men and women are by definition heavily interrelated. In addition, the cluster solutions resembled one another even if the typologies were created separately.

%% For the second stage of the analysis, or the regressions, we stratified the sample by gender. While the relationship histories did not differ, their effects could be different for men and women as suggested by (!!ref \& !!ref). Men and women could respond to similar life events differently or heterogamy could explain why certain relationship types could be more detrimental for some than others: the relationships histories are inherently interconnected.

Health was measured by a one-shot subjective health question and well-being by self-reported life satisfaction, as they are direct and established ways to access well-being.\citep{fischerSubjectiveWellBeingWelfare2009,jenkinsonMeasuringHealthMedical2013} Robustness checks were carried out with grip strength—an objective, consistent and versatile estimator for health \citep{bohannonGripStrengthIndispensable2019}—, and CASP-12, an old age quality of life indicator with a robust theoretical framework \citep{borrat-bessonEvaluationCASP12Scale2015}.

We treated subjective health and life satisfaction as continuous to preserve comparability with Grip Strength and CASP-12. For the same reason, we standardized all continuous and ordinal variables. As \citet[:214-215]{agrestiFoundationsLinearGeneralized2015} points out, using OLS for ordinal response variables can lead to misleading results because of ceiling and floor effects. Therefore we will perform robustness checks with ordinal regression to ensure that such effects are not present.

First regression model does not have any controls, and thus gives as the raw effects of the clusters. Second or main model has controls variable that are not endogenous to the clusters themselves: age, family composition at 10 years of age, and childhood socio-economic background measured by number of books, features and rooms at home, and whether respondent experienced hunger as a minor \citep[see ][for a discussion about the realibility of these measures]{havariCanWeTrust2015}. The third model is an over-controlled one; it makes sure the cluster effects are not merely artifacts of the number of children, educational attainment or income - albeit it is questionable whether such variables that are so heavily influenced by the relationship histories should be included in the first place.

Final model consists of only cluster and education interaction effects for simplicity \toAorB{}{(The results were identical with controls.)} Our intention was to build a three-way interaction effect model with the number of children but the sample size was not large enough for reliable results.

Missing values (please refer to \autoref{tab:descriptives}) were handled with multiple imputation. The analyses were conducted with 6 imputed datasets. 

After wrangling the data with Stata 14 \citep{statacorpStataStatisticalSoftware2017}, all further analyses were conducted with Puhti Supercomputer \citep{cscPuhtiEnvironmentHigh2021} and  R \citep{rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2021}: Sequence analyses with the R package TraMineR \citep{gabadinhoAnalyzingVisualizingState2011}; visualizations with ggplot2 and jtools \citep{wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016,jtools}; multiple imputation with mice \citep{vanbuurenMiceMultivariateImputation2011}; interaction forecasting with emmeans \citep{lenthEmmeansEstimatedMarginal2021}, and tables with table1 \citep{richTable1TablesDescriptive2021}.

A five-cluster solution (\autoref{fig:clusters_and_title}) was the most optimal according to both goodness-of-fit tests and visual inspection (\autoref{fig:s_cluster_fit_comparisons_only_both} and \autoref{fig:tree.s}).

The \emph{monogamous} (1) cluster is characterized by a brief period of dating—and sometimes cohabitation—followed by  a permanent first marriage in the late 20s.

The \emph{remarriage} (2) group tends to marry around their 20s and divorce within the first ten years of marriage. Most will remarry in their 30s. The higher order marriages are often preceded by cohabitation. 

The \emph{dissolution} (3) cluster is practically identical to the first two clusters until the mid-20s. However, unlike in cluster (2), people will remain single or widowed, or start dating or cohabiting after divorce, but will not generally remarry.

Marriages in the \emph{serial cohabitation} (4) cluster are rare, and they usually end in divorce. Cohabiting and dating are prominent throughout the life course, owing at least in part to the considerable amount of variation in the relationship stages after the initial period of singlehood. The sequence index plot (see \autoref{fig:indices_and_title}) reveals that the cluster is, indeed, characterized by serial as opposed to stable cohabitation.

The vast majority in the \emph{single} (5) cluster never date or co-reside. Those who do will, by and large, return to singlehood in a matter of a few years.

\toWorS{\input{descriptive_table.tex}}{} % ref from the file

The demographics of the clusters resemble each other (see \autoref{tab:descriptives}). There are a few exceptions to this rule: men are overrepresented in the singlehood group and women in the dissolution group. While educational differences are generally insubstantial, the level of male educational attainment does decrease when marriages are short. For women, it is the opposite. (\autoref{fig:statsby_cluster_education_gender})

The proportion of people in different relationship categories does not vary much from country to country. Early monogamous trajectories are by far the most common, and single trajectories are the rarest in every country, although the difference in size compared to other clusters is not always considerable.

Further inspection by multinominal regression revealed that some northern European respondents were more likely to belong to the precarious group. No other clear patterns were observed \toAorB{(results omitted for brevity).}{see \autoref{tab:multinom_ref_1}). This is also clear from \autoref{fig:statsby_cluster_country}, where cluster frequencies are listed by country.}

%%%% Well-being outcomes
\subsection*{Well-being outcomes}\label{wellbeing}

Monogamous partnership histories (1) tended to be associated with higher subjective health and especially with life satisfaction (\autoref{fig:multi_sub_life}). The effects remained after controls in Model 2 and even in the over-controlled Model 3. 

Clusters characterized by singlehood (5) and dissolution (3) but not remarriage (2) seemed to be the most vulnerable to lower wellbeing in old age. 

While the direction of association was as expected, the wellbeing of men in the remarriage cluster was not only slightly worse when compared with that of men with monogamous histories. For women, the effect sizes were larger but still modest.

Serial cohabitation (4) was disadvantageous for men. For women, the association depended on education: women with precarious life histories and higher education fared best in all the groups, while those with basic or secondary education seemed to suffer from the complex life histories characterized by serial cohabitation.

A similar trend occurs with those in the divorce (3) cluster for both sexes. Higher education seems to shelter both men and women from the adverse effects of union dissolution. Those with basic and secondary education are considerably worse off if their first marriage has dissolved and they remain unmarried.

\subsection*{Robustness checks}\label{robustness_checks}

The results were similar when measured with grip strength and CASP-12 (\autoref{fig:multi_grip_casp}). The effect sizes were mainly greater, with the exception of grip strength for women, where we found no associations.

As subjective health and life satisfaction were measured on 5- and 11-point scales, we also ran the analyses using ordinal regression. The results were practically identical with the OLS\toAorB{.}{ (see \autoref{fig:polr.all.3}).}

\section*{Discussion and conclusion}\label{discussion}

% link background to this discussion

%%%% Interpretation of results
Stable relationship histories are associated with well-being in old age. Our results indicate that lower education catalyzes the effect of unstable trajectories, while higher education might even reverse the direction of the relationship, especially for women. 

%% Comparison or synthesis with results from litterature

The fact that clusters had no effect on grip strength for women is in line with \citet{oflahertyFamilyLifeCourse2016} who found no psychical health outcomes for women and partnership histories, unless both their marital history was disrupted and they had high fertility. These findings combined would suggest that subjective health could reflect overall contentment whereas grip strength, which is an objective measurement like morbidity, could be more independent of life satisfaction.

Unlike \citep{zimmermannStableCohabitationalUnions2019} our study did find evidence that relationship histories are linked with self-assessed health and quality of life measures also for women, which suggests that the in order to discern the effects of partnership histories, one will have to wait as long as until the verge of retirement for the effects to kick in.

%%%% COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH CROSS-SECTIONAL RESEARCH

% ?? Income women does not reflect their well-being but their partners might.


%% Surprising results?

It came as no surprise that stable single life courses were the worst off, and that those findings were pronounced in men \citep[see ][ for review]{coombsMaritalStatusPersonal1991}. What stroke as was that permanent singlehood hit people of all education levels with the same magnitude.

While education divided the unstable trajectories, we did expect more substantial evidence of cumulative advantage: stable relationship histories in the highly educated did not result in even higher well-being outcomes. As suggested by \citet{ferraroCumulativeInequalityTheory2009}, the impact of cumulative disadvantage is indeed greater. It is nevertheless striking that we found \emph{no} evidence of cumulative advantage, only disadvantage. Greater resource substitution of the highly educated could explain this:  the well educated are less dependent on any given well-being resources, in this case partnership history and, as a consequence, stable partnership histories will not bring with it accelerated well-being outcomes. They are also less vulnerable to unstable or single partnership trajectories \citep[cf.][]{mirowskyEducationCumulativeAdvantage2005}.

%It is likewise possible that those with less resources have inferior opportunities to compensate for life course patterns that tend to deteriorate well-being. We could conclude that education might work as a catalyst or damper when people act against expectations: if their behavior is normative, the effects are will not vary in different demographic segments.

Based on earlier literature \citep{zahl-olsenDivorceRemarriageNorway2019, hagglundVanheneeKuinHyva2021,boothStartingWhyRemarriages1992}, we were were expecting a more distinguishable difference between trajectories characterized by remarriages and those of first marriages. The direction of the relationship was nonetheless  as expected.

Following the life courses until the age of 60 allowed for especially health outcomes to develop, thus emphasizing how life course events increase in magnitude as time elapses. Studying the relationship histories for such a long time period explains at least in part why the effect sizes were so notable. Cross-national sample made it possible to infer general trends and allowed for a reasonable sample size, which also made studying interaction effects possible.


%%%% Possible weaknesses
% ?? Too many weaknesses, remove some?


A pseudo panel has the unfortunate feature that it is more or less selective. Not only are those better off and in relationships more likely to participate, but those who have passed away are excluded by design. As a result, the cumulative disadvantages is most likely stronger in reality than what we observed here \citep[cf. axiom 5 in ][ and in section \ref{cumulative}]{ferraroCumulativeInequalityTheory2009}

%Although the distribution of cluster membership was somewhat even, one trajectory could be sanctioned differently between countries. Granted, this holds for intra-national differences, such as former East and West Germany and the urban-rural division.


The union histories presented here could well reflect the end stages of the relationship histories as most of the people in any given cluster have the same partnership status with one another. How does studying life courses then differ from studying partnership statuses in old age? As we have demonstrated above, well-being effects take decades to develop. Furthermore, a long and stable cohabiting union is qualitatively different from serial cohabitation; someone who gets married for the first time just before retirement certainly  is expected to have led a unique life compared with someone who has been married since their early 20s. Thus, the question can be reversed: why study the current relationship status if that is merely a proxy for relationship histories?

%The retrospective inquiries might not be the most accurate childhood SES estimators. Yet, they offer a glimpse into the time just before the relationship histories start to develop. Even if we did control for childhood circumstances and in the """tårta på tårta""" model income and education, it is possible that some selection """is in play""": advantage start to accumulate in the womb.

%As noted above, most considerations revolve around the appropriateness of survey data in our study setting. As we were interested in outcomes that require subjective assessment or objective measurements as well as information on cohabiting and LAT-relationships in Northern and Western Europe, SHARELIFE data served that purpose well. For a review about the pros and cons of registers and surveys, kindly refer to !!!ref.


% Having said that, our data enabled finding patterns in Northern and Western Europe and hinting towards over-arching trends.

%We did not study relationship satisfaction.\citep{lawrenceMaritalHappinessMarital2019}

%%%% Broader implications.
%% how does relate to other research questions?


The results are in line with the consensus of earlier research: stable monogamous first marriages are associated with a range of well-being outcomes. (\citep{demoSinglehoodMarriageRemarriage1996,kimRelationshipMarriagePsychological2002}) Our findings reinforce the idea that differences in well-being diverge in old age and they take a long time to develop \citep{kuhLifeCourseEpidemiology2003}.

As the effect of non-traditional life courses were dependent on education attainment with this baby-boomer cohort, we should expect similar trends with regards to the even less common organization of love life that are becoming mainstream in the 2020s: those with cultural, social and monetary capital could seem to benefit from non-standard love life; the less well off would not fare so well. The highly educated women in these cohorts who had resources for serial cohabitation were likely a distinct group. Once new forms of family life become commonplace it remains to be seen whether they will affect all demographics the same way.

While social expectations could partly explain the well-being effects, it is likely that the relationship histories themselves are the main factor: studies with younger cohorts where divorce and serial cohabitation has become normative have produced similar findings \citep{lichterSerialCohabitationMarital2008}.

% vähä kuin ne naiset jotka ovat serial cohabitators ja menee hyvin.

% It is most fruitful to study phenomena when the social sanctions are equal. That is rarely the case. Even so, finding patterns in early age when societal changes are just happening could give us vital information what new currents might bring along with them.
%% does it support current hypotheses in your field?
%% how does it relate with literature (wider than topic of this paper)


%%%% Prospects for future research

Future research could try to replicate if objective health measures are not associated with relationship histories for women. Qualitative inquiries could further inform about at the mechanisms behind these differences. Register studies could dig deeper into the combined effect of education, number of children and other demographic characteristics.

More generally, as other relationship forms become more popular, it will be interesting to see whether they will eventually have similar well-being effects as stable marriages. That is, are the well-being outcomes a function of the structure of the relationships or norms regulating family life. 

% Conclusion

Life courses characterized with stable marriages tend to be coupled with good health and high quality of life. Unstable and single histories less so. Education pronounces the effects of unstable love histories and might even reverse them. This hints at family formation patterns that foster well-being, having direct implications on both individual and societal level.
